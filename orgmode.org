## org-mode

this emacs mode has a dedicated page, because it will change the way i make notes and organize information in my life

it is plain-text like txt, but better

build on top of outline mode
the entire document can be organized as a hierarchial structure

we can define headlines and use tab to toggle expand them

* top level headline
** second level
some text in the second level.

TAB and STAB (shift+tab)
use Shift-arrow to assign priority

for globally expanding/dexpanding, we do c-u tab

 --> c-c c-n --> to move to next heading
 --> m-ret --> insert new heading with same level
 --> m-s-ret --> insert new todo with same level
 --> m-left/right --> promote/demote heading level
 --> m-s-left/right --> promote/demote tree level

example:

    ** Lord of the Rings
    My fav scenes are (in this order)
    1) The attack
    2) The flight
       1. awesome in book as well
       2. nice actors
    Important actors:
    - Tom Cruise :: he was awesome
    - Mark Shawn :: he is awesome as well


[[link][desc]] is for links
to open the link, C-c C-o

you can have more info in the links as well. for eg, in the file link:
[[file:~/Downloads/new.py::12]] --> when you open it, emacs moves to line no 12
[[file:~/Downloads/new.py::some_text]] --> when you open it, emacs moves to line with some_text

internal links:
ones that don't look like a url, they are internal in the current file
[[#my-custom-id]] --> this will link to the entry with the property CUSTOM_ID set to "my-custom-id"

[[some_text]] --> this will link to headline (something else too?) that reads some_text


to view the sparse view --> C-c /

organize todos in a list, then enter [/] or [%] in the headline and finally,
to get the fraction or percentage, use C-c C-c

checkboxes - [ ]
here also, you can do [/]
to check the status of the checkbox having children, go to it and do C-c C-c

tags
they can be mentioned at the end of any headline
being and end with a single colon ":"
eg: * read sicp :work:
** read taoup :work:book:

properties - they are key-value pairs associated with an entry

{ to print any variable, use (message var-name) }

capture notes when working - C-c c
archive the todos when they are done: C-c a

highlight code by this:

#+begin_src python

def main():
  print "Hello %s" % ("what's the problem")

#+end_src
