This file mostly has emacs and general shortcuts, django tips and other fun stuff

1.
when developing the new crm module:
The same url online and locally:
online - https://beta.appknox.com/hudson/admin_extras/users
local - crm - http://0.0.0.0:8000/hudson/crm/users
local - crm2 - http://0.0.0.0:8000/hudson/crm2/users (edited)


2.
Use login_required decorator with class based views
`
class NewGuideView(CreateView):

   model = Guide
   form_class = NewGuideForm
   template_name = "guides/guide_new.html"
   success_url = "/" # Just to keep things simple, redirect to root.

   @method_decorator(login_required)
   def dispatch(self, *args, **kwargs):
       return super(NewGuideView, self).dispatch(*args, **kwargs)
`

3.resources for django class views 
django class resource - https://ccbv.co.uk/projects/Django/1.5/django.views.generic.edit/CreateView/

4.
In django, when using the class based views, ALL the important things are stored in `self`. To quote the docs:

> The key part to making this work is that when class-based views are called, various useful things are stored on self; as well as the request (self.request) this includes the positional (self.args) and name-based (self.kwargs) arguments captured according to the URLconf.

What you have to do is, find the suitable method (eg, `get_context_data`) and then use the `self`



5. In django, when using class based views, any arguments passed to the class are stored in `self.kwargs`, or `self.args` accordingly.

6. array keys to move around
to intercept any requests, enter the intercept mode with `i`, filter (to intercept all of them, use `.*`)
to accept a request, use `a`, to accept all of the pending requests, use `A`
to view the request in detail, use `ret`, `e` to edit it, `a` to allow it now
from anywhere, `esc` or `q` to exit
`d` to delete the request

In already sent requests, use `ret` to view the request, `e` to edit it, `q` to stop editing and issue the request, `tab` to view the response or detail etc




4. when you are opening a project for the first time, and you use helm to search for the file, using `c-h h f`, use `c-o` to cycle between the buffer categories - recent, open, current dir...


5. indent or unindent a selected region of code using `c-c >` or `c-c <`

6. to select a logical expression unit - eg, brackets, inverted commas etc - `c-m-spc`. after going to the first bracket, inverted comma etc (edited)

7. when on a line, to move it to the next line, and insert a new line above the present one, do `c-m`

8. when pushing to heroku, i wanted to push `3-heroku` branch and not my master(which is the default), so I did: `git push heroku 3-heroku master` (syntax - `git push remote local_branch_name remote_branch_name`)

9. destroy heroku commands with `(molly) molly 3-heroku-> heroku apps:delete -a <app name>`
10. select all in emacs - `c-x h`
11. in django, App is foreign key to Following. From following to app - `following,objects.get(app=appid)`
from app to following - `App.following_set.filter()` (edited)

12. when you have a lot of windows open, use `shift-arrow keys` to navigate instead of `c-x o`

13. when you have two buffers that you want to go back and forth between, without opening them in a separate frame, use `c-x b ret`, the last opened entry is at the top

14. start irene

15. . .nodeenv/irene/bin/activate
then, start irene using ember serve from Projects/appknox/irene

16. to auto indent selected region of code, c-m-\

17. to create a new py3 virtual env,
go to ~/ENV, do pyvenv scrapy
then, . scrapy/bin/activate
done
also, for nodejs virtualenv, replace pyvenv with nodeenv, rest is the same

18. when in emacs, do
    c-x `
   to go to errors in the file below the point. so, when writing pep8 code for scrapy, use this to go to the next error

19. in emacs, to save the current buffer without the prompt, use c-x c-s
    using c-x s will prompt

20. say you have user, not you want to go from user to the apps he is following
the relation is this: Following has a foreign key relation to User
do this, User.objects.get(name="darshan").following_set.all()
for going from users to project:
User.objects.get(username="darshanime").owned_projects.all() (because project has this line:
    owner = ForeignKey(User, related_name='owned_projects')

21. to open a new terminal window, ctrl-alt-t
to open a new terminal tab in the same window ctrl-shft-t

22. to clear the screen on the terminal ctrl-l

23. when typing a command, do ctrl-r for reverse interactive search

24. this ones a biggie. to go to the next occurance of the text at point,
do, m-n or m-p as required. so, say you are looking at a function, to see where it is
called and its defination etc, do this - m-p or m-n

25. to move a line or region anywhichway, do this:
c-c arrow key

26. when saving a file, if you want to view a diff of what changed, you can do c-x s
when prompted, say s to save, d to show the diff

27. installed direx, now, whenever you clone a new project or just want to explore its directory, do c-x c-j
this will show the tree in an interactive manner

28. to go to a function in the present file, do c-c c-j

29. to go to any url in html for eg, do c-c ret

30. sshing dumps

ssh into droplet:
    ssh -i do.key root@139.59.1.209

login as postgres user:
    sudo -i -u postgres
        OR
    sudo su - radar

start postgres terminal:
    psql
    quit with \q

you are logging into the postgres server using the account named postgres
set its password by loggin in using 
sudo -u postgres psql postgres //this logs in the server, and accesses the postgres database
then: \password postgres //this sets the password for the postgres database
enter it twice and you are done

so, i deleted the existing mycroft database using drop database mycroft
then, i created a new database again using:
sudo -i -u postgres
createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres mycroft
                           port     user   name of the database
                                who owns the
                                database
enter the password for the postgres user and done. 
logout to go back

copy a postgres database into another server:
    
    pg_dump the_db_name > the_backup.sql

    Then copy the backup to your development server, restore with:

    psql the_new_dev_db < the_backup.sql


open the postgres terminal by connecting to a certain database:
    psql -d database_name
    eg: psql -d django

if you are root(postgres), you can connect to it else, you'll need passwords etc

create user in postgres
    createuser --interactive

    \list or \l: list all databases
    \dt: list all tables in the current database

You will never see tables in other databases, these tables aren't visible. You have to connect to the correct database to see its tables (and other objects).

To switch databases:

\connect database_name

See the manual about psql.

copy some contents using xclip

cat filename | xclip -sel clip
cat filename | xclip -selection clipboard
This makes xclip use the selection clipboard for selection, if you omit that, it copies to another clipboard and to paste from there, use middle mouse button


create a python3 virtual env using
    pyvenv <name>
    and then <name>/bin/activate

Also, install packages using pip3 install django --no-cache-dir etc

deploying to heroku

we can deploy to heroku by being in the git project and then, doing heroku create
this will add a remote to the heroku end point
so, now you can do git push heroku master

the tutorial is comprehensive, follow that!

deploying molly
_______________

to create the new user, i did this:
sudo -u radar psql postgres
\du (shows the list of users)

postgres=# drop user molly;
ERROR:  role "molly" cannot be dropped because some objects depend on it
DETAIL:  owner of database test_molly
owner of database molly
postgres=# drop database molly;
DROP DATABASE
postgres=# drop user molly;
ERROR:  role "molly" cannot be dropped because some objects depend on it
DETAIL:  owner of database test_molly
postgres=# drop database test_molly;
DROP DATABASE
postgres=# drop user molly;
DROP ROLE

and then ran this:
echo "molly"
createuser -P molly

now, to migrate, django looks at the settings.py and the database credentials
to log into the postgres server. so, we have to have that there
use env vars:

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': _env(
            'DATABASE_ENGINE', 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2'),
        'NAME': _env('DATABASE_NAME', 'mycroft'),
        'USER': _env('DATABASE_USER', 'mycroft'),
        'PASSWORD': _env('DATABASE_PASSWORD', 'mycroft'),
        'HOST': _env('DATABASE_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
        'PORT': _env('DATABASE_PORT', 5432),
    }
}
