* In which we begin at the beginning 

Twisted operates at a very high level of abstraction, so, it is necessary to start at low level stuff to appreciate Twisted. 

If you have only one core and you want to do multiple tasks, there are 3 ways:

There are 3 main models 

** Synchronous model - Single threaded synchronous model

** Concurrent model - many threads of executions

[[./assets/twisted_3.png]]


Here, the different threads of execution are managed by the operating system, and the host machine may have many cores or even one core (multiplexing)

This works fine if the threads are independent of each other, but if they are not, you have to manage access to shared resources wisely. 
This led to the whole section on Synchronization in OS class

** Asynchronous model - single threaded asynchronous model

In concurrent case, the choice to yield control of a processor is not with the thread (preemption)
but here, the thread has to explicitly yield control

One might argue that if there are no blocking calls at all, the synchronous model will perform _faster_ that the asynchronous model because it has the advantage of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference][locality of reference]] - similar values will be accessed more frequently

** Asynchronous better than Synchronous
 - large no. of tasks -- async will give better responsiveness
 - tasks perform a lot of I/O -- async will execute all faster
 - tasks are independent of each other - simpler to write them in an async fashion

This is perfectly suited for a typical network server (like a web server)

* Slow poetry and the apocalypse

Let's write a webserver that will send poetry when any client connects to it. 
It is a blocking server so it will finish one and then initiate another

It is written using just sockets. It listens for connections and when a connection is initiated, it uses sock.sendall to send some data.

#+begin_src python

    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    sock.bind((options.iface, options.port or 0))

    sock.listen(5)
    while True:
        sock, addr = sock.accept()

    inputf = open(poetry_file)
    while True: # repeat till there is no poem
        bytes = inputf.read(num_bytes) # read some bytes - read num_bytes

        if not bytes: # no more poetry :(
            sock.close()
            inputf.close()
            return

        try:
            sock.sendall(bytes) # this is a blocking call, send num_bytes
        except socket.error:
            sock.close()
            inputf.close()
            return
        time.sleep(delay) # artificial delay
#+end_src
 
Question - here, we are creating a socket and accepting client connections to it and asking it to send a chunk of data. What is the max quantity of data that it can send in one go?
